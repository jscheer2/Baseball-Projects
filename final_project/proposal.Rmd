**Project description.** Provide at least one paragraph describing what your project is about: 
  

My project will be a deep analysis of what happened to the 2023 Padres. They were projected to be a top 5 team in the MLB by most media and power rankings and they ended up being below .500 for most of the season even though they did well in a lot of statistics. So my project would be trying to see what caused them to lose so many games and especially in the first 2/3 of the season, see why they were underperforming.


**Project deliverables.** Provide at least one paragraph describing what you plan to produce: 
  


I plan to produce statistics and reasons as to why they lost so many games and how they underperformed their top 5 projected season. I will find and show their team statistics and their team win and losses in certain scenarios to see if I can find out why they failed.




**Project submission.** Provide at least one paragraph describing how you plan to submit your final project materials: 
  
 

I plan to submit my final project through a PDF like R Markdown either by uploading it to my GitHub like my HW assignments or a pdf version to Canvas depending on which youâ€™d prefer.



**R shiny layout.** Provide a sketch of the proposed layout of your Shiny app, ignore this if you are not creating a Shiny app:
