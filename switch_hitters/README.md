Also in my baseball analytics class, I made a project looking at switch hitting players since 2017 (statcast era) and comparing their OBP as both a lefty and righty against the league average and see if being a switch hitter is beneficial for them or if they should switch to just one side. This was a project that had to be done in R Shiny.


### I need to update this to make it look nicer and to come up with a way to see if a player is beneficial as a switch hitter or just stick to one side. ###
